THE RACKET (TTE Rule 2.4.5) <br>The blade, any layer within the blade and any layer of covering material or adhesive on a side used for striking the ball shall be continuous and even thickness. <br><br>2. SERVICE (TTE Rule 2.6) <br>Service shall start with the ball resting freely on the flat, open palm of the server's stationary hand <br><br>(Rule 2.6.2) <br>The server shall then project the ball near vertically upwards, without imparting spin, so that it rises at least 16cm after leaving the palm of the free hand then falls without touching anything before being struck. <br><br>(Rule 2.6.4) <br>From the start of service until it is struck it, the ball, shall be above the level of the playing surface and behind the server's end line, and it shall not be hidden from the receiver by any part of the body or clothing of the server or his doubles partner. <br><br>(Rule 2.6.5) <br>It is the responsibility of the player to serve so that the umpire or the assistant umpire can see that he complies with the requirements for a good service. <br><br>(Rule 2.6.5.1) <br>If there is no assistant umpire and the umpire is doubtful of the legality of a service he may, on the first occasion in a match, warn the server without awarding a point. <br><br>(Rule 2.6.5.2) <br>If subsequently in the match a service by that player or his doubles partner is of dubious legality, for the same or any other reason, the receiver shall score a point. (Rule 2.6.5.3) Whenever there is a clear failure to comply with the requirements for a good service no warning shall be given and the receiver shall score a point. <br><br>(Rule 2.6.6) <br>Exceptionally, the umpire may relax the requirements for a good service where he is satisfied that compliance is prevented by physical disability. <br><br>Explanation and intent of the new service rule <br>1. As soon as the free hand (the hand holding the ball in service) and arm has projected the ball upwards, the free hand/arm must be immediately removed to the side. In other words, the free arm must not remain in any area between the ball and the receiver - it has to be out of the line of the sight of the receiver and the ball. <br><br>(Rule 2.5 TTE DEFINITION) (2.5.2. SERVICE) <br>The ball is in play from the last moment at which it is stationary on the palm of the free hand before being intentionally projected in service until it touches anything other than the playing surface, the net assembly, the racket held in the racket hand or the racket hand below the wrist, or until the rally is otherwise decided as a let. <br><br>(Rule 2.5.8 TTE DEFINITION) (2.10.1.4a POINT) <br>A player obstructs the ball if he, or anything he wears or carries, touches it in play when it has not passed beyond his end line, not having touched his court since last being hit by his opponent.(note the ball no longer goes out of play if it passes over the playing surface without touching it, unless it also passes beyond the end line at the far end of the table from the striker). <br><br>2. A POINT (TTE Rule 2.10) (Rule 2.10.1.4.) <br>Unless the rally is a let, a player shall score a point if the ball passes beyond his end line without touching his court, after being struck by his opponent. Either player (or pair) shall lose a point: <br><br>(a) if he or his racket, or anything he wears or carries touches the net (including net supports) while the ball is in play; <br><br>(b) if his free hand touches the playing surface while the ball is in play. <br><br>3. A GAME (TTE Rule 2.11.1) <br>A game shall be won by the player or pair first scoring 11 points unless both players or pairs score 10 points, when the game be won by the first player or pair subsequently gaining a lead of 2 points. <br><br>2.13 THE ORDER OF SERVING, RECEIVING AND ENDS (Rule 2.13) 2.13.3 <br>After 2 points have been scored the receiving, player or pair shall become the serving player or pairs and so on until the end of the game, unless both players or pair score 10 points or the expedite system is in operation, when the sequences of serving and receiving shall be the same but each player shall serve only 1 point in turn. <br><br>2.13.6 <br>The player or pair serving first in a game shall receive first in the next game of the match and in the last possible game of a doubles match the pair due to receive next shall change their order of receiving when first one pair scores 5 points.4. <br><br>EXPEDITE RULE (Rule 2.15) <br>Amend: - Except where both players have scored at least 9 POINTS, the expedite system shall come into operation if a game is unfinished after 10 MINUTES' play or at any earlier time at the request of both players or pairs. <br><br>2.15.1.1 <br>If the ball is in play when the time limit is reached, play shall be interrupted by the umpire and shall resume with a service by the player who served in the rally that was interrupted. <br><br>2.15.1.2 <br>If the ball is not in play when the time limit is reached, play shall resume with a service by the player who received in the preceding rally. <br><br>2.15.2 <br>Thereafter, each player shall serve 1 point in turn until the end of the game and if the receiving player or pair makes 13 good returns the receiver shall score a point. <br><br>2.15.3 <br>Once introduced, the expedite system shall remain in operation until the end of the match. <br><br>5. DOUBLES ORDER OF PLAY <br>The pair who serve first in a game shall receive first in the next game. The pair who are to serve first in any game choose which of them will do so. The first receiver shall be the one who served to him in the previous game. <br><br>6. THE RACKET <br>The surface of the covering material on a side of the blade, or of a side of the blade if it is left uncovered shall be MATT BRIGHT RED on one side and BLACK on the other side. A side of the blade used to "Strike" the ball must be covered with either pimples out 2mm maximum thickness, or smooth rubber (pimples in) maximum thickness 4mm. <br><br>NOTE: <br>No uncovered blade must be used for striking the ball. All players are reminded that the above LAW MUST be observed and any player is entitled to refuse to play an opponent with a racket not conforming to the law, and the opponent using the illegal racket will forfeit the game. <br><br>7. (Rule 2.4.8) <br>At the start of a match and whenever he changes his racket during a match a player shall show his opponent and the umpire the racket he is about to use and shall allow them to examine it. <br><br>(Rule 2.4.10) <br>A Racket shall not be changed during an individual match unless it is accidentally damaged so badly that it cannot be used (TTE Law as of 2010). <br><br>8. A LET SERVICE <br>If in a service the ball touches the net, the rally is a "let" unless the ball passes the receiver's end line without touching the side of the table. If it is obstructed over the table by the receiver it is still a let. <br><br>9. LETS <br>It should be noted that the umpire is the sole judge of lets even in the case of an obvious let, play should continue pending the umpires intervention. The umpire is within his rights in penalising any such infringement without prior warning at his discretion, however he may use a warning in the first instance and penalise thereafter. <br><br>10. DRESS <br>Extracts from Rule 3.2.2. Playing clothing shall normally cnsist of a short-sleeved or sleevless shirt and shorts or skirt or one-part sports outfit, socks and playing shoes. Other graments, such as part or all of a tracksuit, shall not be worn during play except with the permission of the referee. The main colour of a shirt, skirt or shorts, other than sleeves and collar of a shirt, shall be clearly different from that of the ball. <br><br>11. INTERVALS <br>Extracts from Rule 3.4.4 Play shall be continuous throughout the match except that any player is entitled to an interval of 1 minute between successive games of a match, brief intervals for towelling after every 6 points from the start of a game and at the change of ends in the last possible game of a match.<br><br>
